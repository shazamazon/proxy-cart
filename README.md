# Project Overview

This is a front-end focused project that I worked on with a team. We created an Amazon clone, called "Shazamazon", which mirrors the look and feel of Amazon's product pages. Our team consisted of 7 people, and we completed this project using an agile workflow on Trello. The project was worked on in two day sprints, with daily stand-up meetings and periodic code shares/reviews. The project took 2.5 weeks to complete.

Each team member had a specific component focus, which they developed individually. They were responsible for the front-end and back-end aspect of their component. Once the component was completed, we combined our components using a microservices architecture, with each component and it's associated database hosted on Amazon EC2/S3 and MongoDB Atlas, respectively. Our components were all brought together on a proxy server hosted on an AWS EC2 server.
